      <h2> Whitehaven Beach</h2>
      <p class="funParagraph" id = "testP">Located on the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef, <b>Whitehaven Beach</b> is used to winning awards. It was
         also named the best beach in Australia by the TripAdvisor Travelers Choice Beaches Awards. Known for its soft, pure
         white silica sand, the 7km beach is one of the most beautiful and unspoilt beaches in the world. Honestly this place is a beautiful and looks very peaceful. One day I will be a good enough programmer in my new career to afford to take my family to this beach its on the top of my list.</p>

         <h2>Playa Ruinas</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph">Mexico's best beach experiences, <b>Playa Ruinas</b>. Come to Playa Ruinas in the early morning or later in the
            evening to enjoy the sands beneath El Castillo  the old Mayan temple without interruption. Also save time for
            Playa Paraiso, the most highly regarded beach in Tulum. <em>Just to add my two cents I am a culture guy. I love to ingrain my self into diffrent cultures and then learn what I can about them and by the looks of the beach its speak culture.</em></p>
